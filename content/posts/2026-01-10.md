Now that we've discussed the benchamrking and analysis methods available to use on from the Programming Language Identitication (PLI) project, I'd like to share some initial tests that I've done with the tool.

## Experiement description
I set up the benchmarking mechanism to record the hardware specification when running the benchmarker, as the existant PLI tooling didn't have an automated mechanism for doing so. Having such a system in place allows to systematically benchmark and compare tool programming language identification tool efficiencies.

The environment settings being recorded consistenly, I set out to run the varying utilities already explored on CodeCommons on Grid5000, an HPC available to French research centers. 

# Programming language identification tools



## Conclusion
Having discussed the result of the programming language identification benchmarking and the analysis format, we'll discuss initial results of programming language identification benchmarking in the next post.

Now that we've discussed the benchmarking and analysis methods available to use on from the Programming Language Identification (PLI) project, I'd like to share some initial tests that I've done with the tool.

## Experiement description and setup
I set up the benchmarking mechanism to record the hardware specification when running the benchmarker, as the existant PLI tooling didn't have an automated mechanism for doing so. Having such a system in place allows to systematically benchmark and compare tool programming language identification tool efficiencies.

The environment settings being recorded consistently, I set out to run the varying utilities already explored on CodeCommons on Grid5000, an HPC available to French research centers. 

### Testing environment
The testing environment which I have access to is called the `Grid’5000`, an HPC available to French research centers. 

As described by themselves "Grid'5000 is a large-scale and flexible testbed for experiment-driven research in all areas of computer science, with a focus on parallel and distributed computing, including Cloud, HPC, Big Data and AI” [1].

It has “8 sites, 31 clusters, 828 nodes, 12328 cores” and 600+ regular users, along with 120 publications per year/2007 total in HAL, mainly in computer science.

It has sites in France’s large cities (and some adjacent to), including Bordeaux, Grenoble, Lille, Louvain, Luxembourg, Lyon, Nancy, Nantes, Rennes, Sophia, Strasbourg, and Toulouse. 

It’s infrastructure team is supported by members of Inria, CNRS, U. Rennes, IMT Atlantique, and U. Lorraine.

Some of it’s key features include:
- resources: “15000 cores, 800 compute-nodes grouped in homogeneous clusters, and featuring various technologies: PMEM, GPU, SSD, NVMe, 10G and 25G Ethernet, Infiniband, Omni-Path”
- reconfiguration and control allowed by a bare-metal foundation
- monitoring and measurement of network and power consumption
- infrastructure and software traceability
- a community of 600+ users
- a RESTful API to abstract infrastructure interface and automate experimentation.

### Programming language identification tools
Now let’s discuss the utilities which we’re testing:

- __GitHub Linguist__: GitHub Linguist is a rule-based and statistical language identification tool used by GitHub to detect programming languages in repositories. It combines filename extensions, shebangs, heuristics, and Bayesian classifiers trained on curated sample files. 
- __go-enry__: go-enry is a Go reimplementation and extension of GitHub Linguist that preserves its heuristic and statistical detection approach. It is optimized for performance and is commonly used in large-scale code analysis pipelines.
- __Hyperpolyglot__: Hyperpolyglot is a Rust-based reimplementation of Linguist-style language detection, emphasizing safety, speed, and easy embedding. It follows heuristic and statistical approaches.
- __cloc__: cloc (Count Lines of Code) identifies programming languages primarily to count blank, comment, and source lines across codebases. Relies on filename extensions and heuristics.
- __Pygments__: Pygments is a syntax-highlighting library that includes language detection based on filename patterns, content heuristics, and lexer guessing. 
- __Guesslang__: Guesslang is an open-source machine-learning-based programming language classifier trained on source code snippets. 
- __Magika__: Magika is a machine-learning-based file type detection tool developed by Google that infers content types directly from raw byte sequences. It can distinguish programming languages and formats without relying on filenames or extensions.



## Conclusion
Having discussed the result of the programming language identification benchmarking and the analysis format, we'll discuss initial results of programming language identification benchmarking in the next post.
